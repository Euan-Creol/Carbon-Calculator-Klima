      "summaryText": "This project reduces deforestation in the Peruvian Amazon by improving forest management and promoting sustainable nut harvesting. This will help protect critical rainforest habitat and endangered species, while supporting the livelihoods of indigenous communities.",
      "expandedText": "This project will dramatically reduce deforestation in the Peruvian Amazon and protect approximately 740,000 acres (300,000 hectares) of rainforest. The project aims to reduce pressure on this biodiversity hotspot by improving forest management and increasing the economic value of the healthy forest. To accomplish this, the project supports sustainable Brazil nut harvesting by local farmers. This allows local communities to reap economic benefits from the forest without diminishing its natural integrity. As a result, over 400 families benefit economically from nut production. In addition, the project will improve monitoring and enforcement in the area and train 460 local people on forest protection practices.",
