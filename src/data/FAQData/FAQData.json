 "FAQs": {
  "1": {
  "panelHeading": "How is my carbon footprint calculated?",
  "panelDetails": "We use the statistics generated by the World Bank. However, we will be launching a few cool features soon that will both allow us to create a more accurate picture of your footprint overtime and only send you the carbon you consume, do check them out in our Road map!"

  "2": {
  "panelHeading": "What difference does offsetting make?",
  "panelDetails": "Offsets when carefully selected, support projects around the globe that would otherwise not be possible to achieve.\n\n Unfortunately low profits and high costs to start these projects often mean that without funding from carbon credits they wouldn’t be possible.\n\nWe are working with professional bodies like VERRA and Gold standard to bring you projects that have been thoroughly checked and assessed by the highest standards to ensure they meet these criteria."

  "3": {
  "panelHeading": "How can I know you are buying credits for me?",
   "panelDetails": "We buy carbon credits from professional bodies like VERRA and Gold Standard. Once we receive the certificates of the Credits, we create unique tokens of these with their individual certificate numbers and all the project details on the blockchain.\n\n This means they are all unique and cannot be duplicated. On the Carbon page, you can see the credits that you have been streamed to you by us.\nAt the bottom you will also see two buttons, ‘View on Etherscan’ and ‘View on VCS’. Think of Etherscan as a giant directory or ledger of all the transactions that happen on the Blockchain. Because each transaction is uniquely identifiable, you can see two things, who owns the credit, in this case if it’s on your account, you.\n\n You can also see your unique account number next to them (you can find this on your account page). The second link, view on VCS, lets you see all the information about your carbon credit on the website of the company that issues the carbon credits. Here you can browse details on the project you supported and much more. That’s the great thing about our credits being on blockchain, you can check and see everything to ensure that you are getting what you paid for."

   "panelHeading": "Do I own my Carbon Credits?",
   "panelDetails": "Yes! And you can verify it too!\n\n That’s the great thing about our credits being on blockchain, you can check and see everything to ensure that you are getting what you paid for.\n\nThis means that unlike other companies that say they buy credits for you, you can’t actually know that. With us you can and you don’t even need to trust us because you can check for yourself.\n\nJust go to the Carbon page on the menu, it’s the little leaf icon, here you can see the credits that you have been given by us. You’ll also see two links at the bottom, ‘View on Etherscan’ and ‘View on VCS’. Think of Etherscan as a giant directory or ledger of all the transactions that happen on the Blockchain.\n\nBecause each transaction is uniquely identifiable, you can see two things, who owns the credit, in this case if it’s on your account that's you and secondly all the unique data on the Credit itself.\n\nThe second link, view on VCS, lets you see all the information about your carbon credit on the website of the company that issues the carbon credits. You can also browse what the project you supported is about and much more. That’s the great thing about our credits being on blockchain, you can check and see everything to ensure that you are getting what you paid for."

   "panelHeading": "What makes you different from other companies?",
   "panelDetails": "We believe the main unique element about Creol is trust.\n\n Because you can verify that you own the credits we issue you (see more about this on the previous FAQ), but also know that these are unique and therefore aren’t simply sold to countless people.\n\nThis means you can trust that your subscription is making the impact that it should.\n\nTrust these days trust is in short supply, but the great thing about Creol is, you don’t have to trust us, because you can check that it is all true!"

  "panelHeading": "What else are you up to?",
  "panelDetails": "The mission of Creol has always been to empower and inform people about how they can help make positive changes in the way they live to reduce their carbon footprint.\n\nWe know that environmental issues are complex and knowing how you can make a difference is baffling.\n\nSo we wanted to do three main things for our customers.\n\nFirst, give them clear concise data about their carbon footprints in their daily lives and in the environments they use.\n\nSecond, give them the power to make changes with that information.\n\nThird, record and exchange that information in a way that they can trust.\n\nWe’ve included blockchain technology for that exact reason, because with all the information being recorded live on blockchain, you don’t have to trust us, you can check, and verify it all.\n\nSo to understand and control your personal Carbon footprint, there is Creol Carbon Stream. \n\nIf you want to reduce the Carbon footprint of the buildings you use, whether at home or at work, you may also be interested in our main IoT product for buildings, our IoT control system to help reduce the Carbon impact of buildings powered with blockchain technology.
